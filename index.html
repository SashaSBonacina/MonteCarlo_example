    <h1> Monte Carlo Methods </h1>
    <p> Suppose you are given the following question: 
        <b>There are 5 babies in a room, 2 boys and 3 girls. A new baby enters the room. A nurse picks a baby at rondom. The baby is a boy. What is the probability the new baby is a boy?</b></p><p>
        This is a question I stumbled upon in a job interviewed. Now for some this question can be answered with a couple of lines of maths using probability, but for others this may not be the case. 
        This brief page aims to show how Monte Carlo methods can be emplyoyed to solve problems where you may not know the maths or be an expert. First I shall go through the mathematical solution (you do not have to understand this)
        annd then I shall cover how Monte Carlo methods can help us.
    </p>
    <h1> The Math </h1>
    Suppose b represent the new baby where M is Male (boy) and F is female (Girl), and n represent the nurse selection.
    \[\mathbb{P}(b=M|n=M) = ?\] 
    \[Prior Probability: \mathbb{P}(b=M) = 0.5\]
    \[\mathbb{P}(n=M|b=M) = \frac{3}{6} = 0.5 \]
    \[\mathbb{P}(n=M|b=F) = \frac{2}{6} = \frac{1}{3}\]

     \[Bayes Rule: \mathbb{P}(A|B) = \frac{\mathbb{P}(B|A)\mathbb{P}(A)}{\mathbb{P}(B)}   \]


    \[\mathbb{P}(b=M|n=M)  = \frac{\mathbb{P}(n=M|b=M)\mathbb{P}(b=M)}{\mathbb{P}(n=M)}   \]

    \[\mathbb{P}(n=M) = \mathbb{P}(n=M|b=M)*\mathbb{P}(b=M) + \mathbb{P}(n=M|b=F)*\mathbb{P}(b=F) = 0.5*0.5 + \frac{1}{3}*0.5  \] 


    \[\mathbb{P}(b=M|n=M) = \frac{0.5*0.5}{0.5*0.5 + \frac{1}{3}*0.5} = \frac{0.5}{0.5 + \frac{1}{3}} = \frac{3}{5}\]


So our answer is 0.6. 



    <h1> Monte Carlo Methods </h1>
    <p>
As questions like these get more and more complex, they require more thought and expertise. What if there is a way to solve this problem with no knowledge of statistics? Well this is the solution! Monte Carlo Methods essentially simulate the 
situation and run enough trial to obtain a robust result. So our pseudo code is as follows for this specific question.
<pre>
<h2>Code</h2>
<code> 
n = 1,000,000 
samples = 0
successfull_selection = 0
successfull_sample = 0
new_baby = ''
for i in range n:
        num_girls = 3
        num_boys = 2
        if random(0,1) == 1:
            new_baby = 'b'
            num_boys += 1
        else:
            new_baby = 'g'
            num_girls += 1
        if 'b' == random.choice(['b','g'], prob = [num_boys/6, num_girls/6]):
            successfull_selection += 1
            if new_baby == 'b':
                successfull_sample += 1
return successfull_sample/successfull_selection

</code>
</pre>
In this code we are sampling the scenario given, and we are only interested in the sample <i>if</i> the nurse selects a boy as this is what the 
question tells us. And out of these samples we look at how many time was the new baby a boy and this is our result. 
</p>

<h2>Results</h2>

After running 1,000,000 trials our aproximation is 0.0003 off the actual value of 0.6.

<p> Is clear how MC can be used as this code requires no knowledge of probability or Bayes theorem however are results are still accurate.</p>
